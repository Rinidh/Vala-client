why background-color in App.css and index.css not working

use SearchInput somewhere

<AspectRatio maxW="600px" ratio={2 / 1}>
  <iframe //to embed imgs, videos, google maps etc
    title="naruto"
    src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QhBnZ6NPOY0"
    allowFullScreen
  />
</AspectRatio>

Console error advises to put "---/*" to avoid render-loop eg
  assume <Route path="app/*" element={<App />} /> in AppRoutes

use <Lorem count={1} /> in chakra to gen block of text

handling a click event on a chakra Box;
  the autocompletion doesn't show that the e.target obj has the .textContent prop, yet on logging e.target, it's there
  This prop may be special to chakra comps
  I created a new type def with it
  how should I combine the types at same time be able to pass it without error to the onClick prop of the Box, as the func
    it accepts doesn't allow a param with union or intersection types
